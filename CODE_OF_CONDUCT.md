# Code of Conduct

This project follows the **Contributor Covenant** (short form).

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Assume positive intent.
- No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Use constructive feedback; focus on the code, not the person.

Maintainers may take actions including warnings or removal of content when behavior violates the code of conduct.

For escalations, please open a **`security`**-labeled, private issue or email the maintainers if available.
